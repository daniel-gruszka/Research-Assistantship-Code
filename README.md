# Research-Assistantship-Code
MATLAB code that I created while working as a research assistant from 2022-2024
The file 'LGCA_HexagonalLattice_v5_nonSticky_multi' is a model I created with the help of my advisor. The code models the movement of cell aggregation with the ability to change multiple parameters.
